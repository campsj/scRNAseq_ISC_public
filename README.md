# ISC_public_scRNAseq
Comparison of ISC clusters in public scRNAseq data

This repository contains example scripts of the analysis done on comparing own generated scRNAseq data generated in Camps et al Cell Reports 2020 with two other limb muscle scRNAseq datasets Giordani et al Molecular Cell 2019 (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1097276519301376?via%3Dihub) and the tabular muris consortium (http://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0590-4).

Overview of the scripts
- 01: Preparation of Giordani and Tabula muris datasets with QC, clustering, differential expression and cell type annotation
- 02: Comparison of top markers genes between datasets
- 03: Integration of all limb muscle cells with seurat
- 04: Integration of ISCs with seurat
- 05: Analysis of satellite cells of tabula muris data
